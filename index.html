            <p class="hidden">The campaign story of Vanguard is told throughout various points in time in a
                non-chronological order.
                <br><br>
                In August 1941, 2nd Lieutenant Lucas Riggs is stationed at Tobruk, Libya as part of the Australian-led
                Rats of Tobruk garrison. After a failed ambush attempt against a German Afrika Korps convoy, Riggs is
                assigned to recover supplies for the British Army, alongside fellow Rat Private Desmond "Des" Wilmot and
                British Lieutenant Richard Jacobs. Riggs, Des and Jacobs manage to find intelligence relating to General
                Erwin Rommel, and destroy an enemy depot in the process, but they were detained by Major Henry Hamms for
                insubordination. In October 1942, during the Second Battle of El Alamein, Riggs and the Rats are ordered
                by Hamms to form a defensive line, but Riggs disobeys the command and tries to retake a hill and call in
                bomber support with Des supporting him. The two of them succeed, though Des is killed in action. Angered
                by the disregard for the Rats' contribution to the fight, Riggs punches Hamms out of frustration,
                resulting in him facing prison time.
                <br><br>
                In June 1942, United States Navy pilot Lieutenant Wade Jackson participates in the Battle of Midway with
                his tail gunner, Aviation Machinist's Mate Mateo Hernandez. In November 1943, while assaulting the
                Imperial Japanese Army in Bougainville, Jackson and Hernandez's plane is shot down, and the two are
                captured by IJA soldiers. They are rescued by the 93rd Infantry Division, who later help them acquire an
                Imperial Japanese Navy Aichi D3A to assist the division in reclaiming the island.
                <br><br>
                In August 1942, Red Army nurse Polina Petrova witnesses the Germans invade Stalingrad. She fails to save
                her father Boris from being executed by enemy troops, but is able to escape with her brother Misha and
                several Soviet partisans. Petrova eventually acquires the nickname "Lady Nightingale" as she pursues Leo
                Steiner, the Wehrmacht commander responsible for the invasion. In January 1943, Petrova and Misha
                attempt to assassinate Steiner in Stalingrad, but Misha is severely wounded. He sacrifices himself to
                buy Petrova time to escape. Petrova eventually confronts Steiner and kills him and his personal army,
                inspiring the citizens of Stalingrad to reclaim the city from the Nazis. She then sets her sight on
                Steiner's superior, Hermann Freisinger.
                <br><br>
                In June 1944, British paratrooper Sergeant Arthur Kingsley takes part in Operation Tonga, where he and
                the Parachute Regiment help destroy the Merville Gun Battery and several other bridges to assist the
                Allied forces in invading Normandy. Kingsley befriends fellow paratrooper Sergeant Richard Webb, who
                would later become Kingsley's right-hand man.
                <br><br>
                Kingsley, Webb, Petrova, Jackson and Riggs, alongside a sixth soldier named Milos Novak, would
                eventually be recruited by Captain Carver Butcher to form the first special operations task force,
                callsign Vanguard.[c] Kingsley is appointed as the leader of the task force. In April 1945, Task Force
                Vanguard hijacks a train to Hamburg, Germany, in search of intelligence regarding Project Phoenix, a
                secret Nazi program run by Freisinger. While infiltrating a Kriegsmarine submarine, the squad is
                captured by Freisinger's men, minus Jackson who evaded them, and Novak who is bludgeoned to death by
                Freisinger. Vanguard is delivered to the Gestapo headquarters in Berlin, where Freisinger appoints
                Schutzstaffel officer Jannick Richter to interrogate them. Jackson is also later captured after
                attempting to steal a plane at the Berlin Tempelhof Airport; Richter demoralizes the squad by executing
                Webb.
                <br><br>
                Being unaware of Project Phoenix's purpose and Freisinger's involvement, Richter attempts to learn more
                by interrogating Petrova and Riggs about Steiner and Rommel's connection to Freisinger. He deduces that
                the project was a coup attempt, in order to appoint Freisinger as the new Führer of the Fourth Reich. As
                Berlin falls under siege by the Red Army following Adolf Hitler's suicide, Riggs breaks out of
                interrogation and frees the squad, while Kingsley kills Richter to avenge Webb. Vanguard pursues
                Freisinger to Tempelhof, where they finally apprehend him and burn him alive. The four then board
                Freisinger's Luftwaffe plane, discovering numerous German documents and assets, revealing global Nazi
                covert operations. Kingsley decides to follow up on Project Aggregat, a secret V2 rocket facility, and
                orders Jackson to fly there in pursuit.

            <p class="hidden">
                In January 1981, CIA SAD/SOG operatives Russell Adler, Alex Mason, and Frank Woods are sent to target
                Qasim Javadi and Arash Kadivar for their roles in the Iran hostage crisis. With intelligence gained from
                interrogating Qasim, the team tracks Arash to Turkey. Arash boasts that Perseus was the one responsible
                for organizing the hostage crisis before being executed. US President Ronald Reagan authorizes a black
                operation team to neutralize Perseus after being briefed of his threat by Jason Hudson and Adler.
                <br><br>
                Adler's team consists of CIA operative Lawrence Sims, American born Mossad operative Eleazar "Lazar"
                Azoulay, and MI6 intelligence officer Helen Park, with Mason and Woods providing tactical support. The
                final member of the team is an agent known only by the codename "Bell", who served with Adler and Sims
                in MACV-SOG during the Vietnam War. The team starts by asking Bell to recall Operation Fracture Jaw in
                1968, where Adler believes he, Bell, and Sims first encountered Perseus. Afterwards, the team proceeds
                to East Berlin to apprehend/kill Anton Volkov, a Russian mafia boss with ties to Perseus.
                <br><br>
                Following an infiltration into a secret Spetsnaz training facility by Bell and Woods, the team discovers
                that Perseus had infiltrated Operation Greenlight, a top secret American program that secretly planted
                neutron bombs in every major European city to deny their use to the Soviets in the event of an invasion.
                Mason and Woods are deployed to Mount Yamantau in the Ural Mountains, where they infiltrate Nikita
                Dragovich's destroyed base in hopes of retrieving his list of sleeper agents.[c] However, the team finds
                out that Perseus has wiped the data from the Yamantau base's mainframe, leaving their only option to
                infiltrate KGB Headquarters to retrieve the list. Enlisting the help of one of their KGB double agent
                allies, Dimitri Belikov, they manage to get Adler and Bell inside the Lubyanka Building. The team learns
                that an Operation Greenlight scientist is one of the sleeper agents and has fled to Cuba. Hoping to
                catch Perseus there, the team launches a raid. They learn that Perseus has managed to steal the
                detonation codes for every Operation Greenlight bomb, meaning he can devastate Europe and lay the blame
                on the United States. The team comes under heavy fire and Lazar and Park are injured in the process,
                leaving Bell only enough time to save one of them.
                <br><br>
                After rescuing Bell, Adler continues to press them by provoking their memories of Vietnam once more. At
                this point, Bell's true identity is revealed as an agent of Perseus, having been shot by Arash in Turkey
                out of jealousy. Bell was found by Adler and was brainwashed using Project MKUltra into believing they
                were his comrade. With Bell's memory returned, Adler interrogates them on the location of Perseus'
                headquarters. Bell can then either choose to remain loyal to Perseus and lie to Adler, or choose to
                betray Perseus and reveal his location.

                In 2019, during a covert operation in Verdansk, Kastovia to recover shipments of dangerous chemical gas
                headed for Urzikstan, CIA SAC/SOG officer "Alex" is intercepted by unknown hostiles who kill the Marine
                Raiders accompanying him, and escape with the gas. Alex's handler, CIA Station Chief Kate Laswell,
                requests the assistance of British SAS Captain John Price in recovering the chemicals and de-escalating
                the situation with Russia. Twenty-four hours later, a group of suicide bombers, affiliated with the
                terrorist organization Al-Qatala, attack Piccadilly Circus in London. SAS Sergeant Kyle "Gaz" Garrick,
                who has been following the suspected terrorists with a unit of MPS CTSFO officers, is dispatched to
                contain the situation with the assistance of Price and local police forces. Afterwards, Alex is sent to
                Urzikstan to meet up with rebel leader Farah Karim. She agrees to join forces in tracking down the
                chemicals, in exchange for his aid in overthrowing Russian forces led by General Roman Barkov.
                <br><br>
                SAS forces led by Price and Garrick raid an Al-Qatala-occupied townhouse in London, where they learn the
                location of their leader, Omar "The Wolf" Sulaman. Alex, accompanied by Sergeant Marcus Griggs and the
                Demon Dogs, move on Ramaza Hospital in Urzikstan and capture the Wolf. Later, the Wolf's right-hand man,
                Jamal "The Butcher" Rahar, launches an attack on the United States Embassy in Urzikstan in an attempt to
                free the Wolf. Price, Garrick, Alex, and Farah work together to secure the Wolf, but ultimately fail.
                Farah later comes up with a plan to ambush the Wolf's men in the "Highway of Death" in Urzikstan. The
                plan fails when Barkov's men attack both the rebel forces and Al-Qatala militants. Farah's brother and
                second in command, Hadir, is revealed to be the thief who stole the chemical shipment; in an attempt to
                drive off the hostile forces, Hadir sets off the chemicals in the area, killing all of Barkov's men and
                Al-Qatala forces, with Farah and Alex narrowly escaping death.
                <br><br>
                In 1999, Farah and Hadir, were left orphaned during Barkov's invasion. The two attempted to escape the
                country, but were captured by Barkov himself and imprisoned for the next ten years. While in captivity,
                Farah rose to the rank of Commander of the rebel forces, and eventually executed a breakout from
                Barkov's prison camp with the help of a young Price. Back in the present day, Hadir has seemingly joined
                forces with Al-Qatala, forcing Farah and Price's team to take action. They infiltrate the Wolf's hidden
                base and manage to kill him, though fail to locate Hadir. With the gas still at large, the U.S.
                government declares Farah's army a terrorist threat. Disgusted with his government, Alex stays in
                Urzikstan to fight as part of Farah's army.
                <br><br>
                Following intel on a possible attack in Russia orchestrated by Hadir, Price and Garrick head to St.
                Petersburg and meet up with one of Price's old contacts, Nikolai. They manage to intercept an Al-Qatala
                meeting and apprehend the Butcher. As the Butcher refuses to give in to interrogation, Price resorts to
                using his wife and son, forcing him to comply. Garrick is given the choice to either execute the Butcher
                or let him live. They learn that Hadir plans to attack Barkov at his estate in Baurci, Moldova, and
                proceed to intercept him. At the estate, the two learn from Hadir of the location of Barkov's gas
                factory in Borjomi, Georgia, and narrowly escape. However, Laswell arrives, informing Price that Russia
                demands Hadir be handed over to them. Price begrudgingly complies, on the condition that they keep the
                intel on the gas factory. Price and Garrick meet up with Farah and Alex at Urzikstan, then plan their
                attack on the factory. With assistance from Laswell, the team advances on the factory, and attempts to
                use explosives provided by Nikolai to demolish the facility. However, the detonator is damaged in the
                fight, and Alex volunteers to set up the explosives manually, seemingly sacrificing his own life. As
                Barkov attempts to escape the facility by helicopter, Farah ambushes and kills him. Farah's forces and
                Price's team evacuate as the factory is destroyed.
                <br><br>
                With Barkov dead and disowned by Russia, Price meets with Laswell to discuss the creation of Task Force
                141 in preparation against the Russian terrorist Victor Zakhaev. Price reviews the files of potential
                recruits with Laswell: Garrick, John "Soap" MacTavish, and Simon "Ghost" Riley.

                United States Army Private First Class Ronald "Red" Daniels (Brett Zimmerman), of the 1st Infantry
                Division, takes part in the Normandy landings with his platoon, including Private First Class Robert
                Zussman (Jonathan Tucker), Technical Sergeant William Pierson (Josh Duhamel), and First Lieutenant
                Joseph Turner (Jeffrey Pierce). Following the landings, Zussman is stabbed by a German soldier,
                resulting in his hospitalization.
                <br><br>
                Zussman returns to duty in time for the American breakout Operation Cobra, where American forces reclaim
                the town of Marigny. The platoon is ordered by Colonel Davis (Matt Riedy) to conduct an operation with
                British Special Operations Executive officers Major Arthur Crowley (David Alpay) and Vivian Harris
                (Helen Sadler) to intercept a German armored train carrying V2-rockets. Daniels and Zussman derail the
                train before being escorted back to their squad by French Resistance leader Camille "Rousseau" Denis
                (Bella Dayne).
                <br><br>
                A week later, Rousseau and Crowley infiltrate a German garrison in Paris to retrieve explosives in
                preparation for the platoon's assault upon it. Rousseau places explosives on the entrance and
                assassinates Ordnungspolizei SS-und Polizeiführer Heinrich (J. Paul Boehmer) for his murder of her
                family, allowing the platoon to liberate Paris.
                <br><br>
                Two months later, the platoon enters Aachen, supported by tank commander Staff Sergeant Augustine Pérez
                (Christian Lanz). They are ordered to take over a German-occupied hotel. They discover civilians inside
                the hotel's basement, and Turner orders their evacuation. After Daniel rescues a young girl named Anna
                (Lilith Max), German soldiers open fire on a truck carrying the civilians, killing Anna's older sister,
                Erica. Pierson sends the truck away without protection.
                <br><br>
                At the Battle of Hürtgen Forest, the platoon is ordered to take Hill 493. Pierson and Zussman are tasked
                with advancing towards the hill, while Turner and Daniels cover them until they can meet at the bottom.
                Turner's squad discovers that Pierson flagrantly ordered an attack on the hill, forcing Turner to join
                in. The platoon destroys artillery positions, but the Germans attack with a Tiger II tank. Daniels is
                injured disabling the tank, which is destroyed by Pérez, who is killed by the tank in turn. Turner is
                wounded rescuing Daniels, and sacrifices himself to cover the platoon's escape. In the aftermath,
                Pierson becomes head of the platoon and promotes Daniels to Corporal.
                <br><br>
                During the Battle of the Bulge, the platoon is surrounded by Germans. African-American combat engineer
                Howard (Russell Richardson) helps the platoon contact air support. The platoon captures several German
                soldiers, and discovers that the Germans plan to destroy the bridge at Remagen, the last bridge over the
                Rhine. After destroying the explosives in transit, the platoon attacks a nearby air base to destroy the
                remaining explosives. The attack fails, resulting in Zussman being captured. Daniels disobeys Pierson
                and attempts to pursue the truck carrying Zussman, but is hospitalized and Pierson denys him from the
                platoon. In Stalag IX-B, Zussman is beaten by SS officer Metz (George Regout) and sent to a
                concentration camp.
                <br><br>
                After recovering for eight weeks, Daniels refuses to abandon Zussman. He learns about the events that
                changed Pierson in the Battle of Kasserine Pass: instead of Pierson recklessly leading his men to their
                deaths, as believed, he disobeyed orders to retreat in a failed attempt to save part of his platoon.
                Daniels confronts Pierson and tears up his honorable discharge papers when Pierson doubts his notions of
                sacrifice. The platoon capture the last bridge over the Rhine. They heads into Germany, liberating
                concentration camps in search of Zussman, eventually reaching the Berga concentration camp, which they
                find abandoned; the camp's survivors were sent on a death march. Daniels finds and saves Zussman by
                killing Metz before he can execute him.
                <br><br>
                At the end of the war, Daniels parts ways with his platoon and returns to Texas, reuniting with his wife
                and newborn son. He visits the grave of his older brother, Paul (Chris Browning), who died from injuries
                he sustained after fighting a wolf that Daniels failed to shoot, and places his Bronze Star medal on the
                grave.
